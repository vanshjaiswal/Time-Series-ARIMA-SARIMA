## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs time series analysis on a given dataset. The analysis includes checking for stationarity, and implementing ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast future values.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing the time series data
- Identifying trends, seasonality, and noise

## Stationarity Check

- Importance of stationarity in time series analysis
- Methods to check stationarity:
  - Visual inspection
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

## Time Series Decomposition

- Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Visual representation of the decomposed components

## ARIMA Model

- Introduction to ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Steps to implement ARIMA:
  - Identification of parameters (p, d, q)
  - Fitting the ARIMA model
  - Diagnostic checks
- Forecasting using the ARIMA model

## SARIMA Model

- Introduction to SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- Steps to implement SARIMA:
  - Identification of seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, m)
  - Fitting the SARIMA model
  - Diagnostic checks
- Forecasting using the SARIMA model

## Results

- Comparing the performance of ARIMA and SARIMA models
- Visualizing the forecasted values against actual values

## Conclusion

- Summary of findings
- Insights gained from the time series analysis
- Recommendations for further analysis
